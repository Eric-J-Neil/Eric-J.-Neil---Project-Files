# PRIME Model - 'Physically-Based Root Water Uptake Isotope Mixing Estimation'
The PRIME model combines a continuous and parametric probability density function 
for root water uptake with site physical data in a process-based linear mixing framework, written in MatLab language.

# Program Files
The "PRIME-Model" file contains the main program.

The "RootUptakePDF" file contains the root water uptake functions.

The "PRIME input data" files contain organized sample data from the original data (raw) and 
corrected data (xylem water compositions were corrected following cryogenic vacuum distillation)
from Nisbet Provincial Forest, Saskatchewan, Canada from August 13, 22, 29, and September 4, 2019.
