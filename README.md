# PRIME Model - 'Physically-Based Root Water Uptake Isotope Mixing Estimation'
The PRIME model combines a continuous and parametric probability density function 
for root water uptake with site physical data in a process-based linear mixing framework, written in MatLab language.

# Program Files
The "PRIME-Model" file contains the main program written in MatLab script.
The "RootUptakePDF" file contains the root water uptake functions, which is called by the main program.
